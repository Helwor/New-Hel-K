# New-Hel-K

QUICK GUIDE

You can either directly copy paste all the files in your InstallDir/LuaUI or put only Hel-k_Update.bat in it and run the .bat

If you only use my widgets, you can uncomment the check for removal in the .bat, so if files are moved/deleted from 

the repo, they will also be deleted (actually renamed) when you use the .bat

The script keep a copy of all the files it modifies, renaming them with .backup1 or .removed

Once you copied/updated the files:

- In the ingame menu check "Show Advanced Settings" in Settings/Misc

- a button "Local Widget Config" should appear, click on it, enable both options in the window appearing.

- do /luaui reload ingame to reload every widgets and the ui system

- ALT + F11 show the widgets list, allow you to enable/disable desired widgets. Though make sure to not disable 

non-end user widget, if you're unsure, better not disable it (Read Description).

- join #hel-k room in lobby to discuss about hel-k and get in touch when new files are updated
